# Physical setup:

- The frame should be based on:
http://www.instructables.com/id/Book-Scanner-Low-cost-easy-to-make-1000-pages-an-h/
(minimal contructionwork, lightweight, easily expandable into fully automatic movement by adding motors, low-cost)

- The brain of the machine (controlling the camera's, reading the images, putting them into the correct order,
converting the images into searchable pdf's, etc.) is a Raspberry Pi (specifiy which model will be used).

- The two camera's should be:

https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/raspbian/applications/camera.md
https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/camera/raspicam/raspistill.md/
www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/01/18/multiple-cameras-with-the-raspberry-pi-and-opencv/
www.pyimagesearch.com

- To trigger the camera's, mount a button on the side so that when pages are pressed a new set of captures
are taken.

# Code setup:

- Installing x-bian: choose between raspbian, minibian, etc.
- Make a bash script that triggers:
-- Python script to:
0) understand start & end of 1 book (button pressed over 5 sec.?)
1) read button pressed
2) trigger image-capture commands
3) ensure correct order of files
4) paste all files together into one file (at the end)
5) copy file into backup, and convert into searchable pdf
6) optional: automatically email/upload to personal cloud
